# Project Title

The goal of this project is to build a full stack application cloning youtube without using their API.
Though users cannot upload their own videos they can search and view contents of the video as well as 
save and like videos. I did not use Youtube Api that they have built. I wanted to scrape content from a 
website as well as build my own authentication system.
